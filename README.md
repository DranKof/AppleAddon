# NutStash

**Why the name?**
Originally the name was "Apple Addon". The name was given because the flag for the start of the embedded file was arbitrarily just "Apple!". But after several people were like, "Apple? What does this have to do with Apple products?" I decided to take a different friend's advice and just follow the nomenclature of all my "Net" tools and name it "Nut"-something. He continued, though there is no networking going on behind the scenes, he thought that it just fits in and squirrels hide away nuts in plain sight, very similar to what this program does. "NutStash" it is.

# How-to:

**Download the program:**
Get it from the <a href="https://github.com/DranKof/NutStash/releases">releases</a> section above.

**Attach a Secret Message:**
1) Click on Load Image, select the image.
2) Click on Load Text, select the text file.
3) Click "Attach" then save the new file somewhere.

**Detach a Secret Message:**
1) Click on Load Image, select the image.
2) If you have a text file loaded, click on the "X" next to the file name to de-select it.
3) Click "Detach" then save the output file somewhere.

# Does it work with other file types?
Yes. It should be very easy to do now.

# Should I actually use this to hide my secrets?
Make sure you keep the exact same version that you use when you store your files away to be safe.

# Will new versions of the program work on files that have hidden messages that were hidden with older versions of this program?
Nothing about the encryption and decryption should change. I think the file end/start key(s) should stay the same, too. As everything about this program is relying on .Net and encryption standards to remain the same, which they generally do, everything should work even after updates, but we can't be certain.
